## 1. Information We Collect
Atom Music Bot collects certain data to provide and improve our service. If you use the Last.fm integration, your Last.fm data, such as scrobbles, may be shared and synced with Last.fm. However, we do not store any scrobble data; it is only passed directly to Last.fm. Only your Last.fm public profile url and your Discord ID is stored as long as you're connected the bot to your Last.fm account.

## 2. User Data and Playlists
If you create playlists within Atom Music, the songs, their metadata, and your user ID are stored to manage your playlist. This data helps the bot to serve you better and personalize your music experience, but it is not shared with third parties.

## 3. Premium Subscriber Data
For users who subscribe to premium services, we store basic information, including your user ID, username and email, to verify your subscription. All these data are provided by our Payment Processor [Patreon](https://patreon.com) This data is used solely for validation purposes to ensure you have access to premium features. For more information on how your data is handled and or processed including your payment details, consider visiting Patreon's Privacy Policy.

## 4. Server and Command Data
Atom Music stores basic server-related information, such as server ID, connected channel ID, text channel ID, and bot permissions. We also track how many commands are used within each guild to monitor usage and gather anonymous analytics.

## 5. Data Security and Retention
We take steps to protect the data you share with us. All collected data is used only for the operation of the bot and is not shared with third parties, except as necessary to provide the service (e.g., Last.fm integration which is itself a service). We retain user data only as long as required to provide the service, and we ensure it is protected from unauthorized access.

## 6. Deletion of Data
All server-related data is automatically deleted from our databases when you kick the Atom Music bot form your Discord server. The user-related data is also deleted after 12 months of inactivity i.e. not accessing the data. Data of Premium subscribers stay as long as they're an active subscriber. If you want a manual request to delete your user-related or server-based data, you can [Contact us](https://discord.gg/TNpWmfmhk7) any time.
